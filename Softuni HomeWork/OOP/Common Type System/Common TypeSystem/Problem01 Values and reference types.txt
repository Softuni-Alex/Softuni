				   Problem 01. Value and Reference types


 1.Which .NET data types are value types?
 - Primitive types: like Int,Float,Bool, Structures.

 Which types are reference types?
 - interface, array, class, dynamic.

 2. How do value and reference types differ when assigned to a variable? 
 - The new value types are assigned to the variable.

 3. How do value and reference types behave when passed as argument to a method?
 - In Reference types, the variable has only an adress of it in the memory.

 4. Where in memory are value types allocated? Where are reference types allocated?
 - In the heap

 5. What is data mutation?
 - Data mutation is changing the value within the same variable.
 
 Can value types be mutated?
 - int double, bool, and etc. are immutable, it means that they cant be mutated.

 Can reference types be mutated?
 - Yes they can.

 6. What is the difference between mutating and setting (assigning) a variable? Give examples.
You cant change int's value, you can only assign a new value to the variable:
 - x = 10;
 - x = x - 5;

 7. What are the out and ref keywords used for?
 - They indicate passing the parameter by reference.
 
 In what do they differ?
 - ref causes an argument to be passed by reference, not by value.
 - When a method uses the out modifier, you can be sure that after you invoke it, your variable is assigned.
